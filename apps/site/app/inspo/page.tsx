            Not with one prompt. With a long brief, a lot of questions, and every correction written down as a rule so it couldn&rsquo;t come back. Claude Opus did the building, a live Artifact was the bench, and the judgement stayed with me.

          <p className="inspo-p">
            I&rsquo;d been collecting interfaces that feel alive without moving much. One was a section of linear.app: three small line figures that answer the pointer so quietly you only notice late that they&rsquo;ve been listening the whole time.
          </p>
          <p className="inspo-p">
            I didn&rsquo;t want those figures. I wanted to know why the feeling works, so I could build my own on purpose instead of by imitation.
          </p>
          <Shot src={linear} priority alt="Linear's three line figures, Fig 0.1 to 0.3, drawn in thin grey strokes on near-black: a stack of rounded layers with a sun on top, a cluster of rounded cubes, and a row of plates rising in height." caption="The reference, for the feeling: Fig 0.1 to 0.3 on linear.app." />

        <Step n={2}>
          <p className="inspo-p">
            The first prompt was long, and most of it wasn&rsquo;t about drawing. It said what I was making, what I wanted to understand first, what was off limits, and what shape the answer had to take.
          </p>
          <Prompt label="The brief, paraphrased">
            <Part name="What I'm making">
              A small library of isometric line figures for product interfaces, drawn in SVG, that respond to the pointer. Not illustrations that sit there: instruments that read the cursor.
            </Part>
            <Part name="Understand first">
              The attached section is a reference for a feeling, not a look. Before you draw anything, take it apart. Give me numbers, not adjectives: timing, stagger, easing, how the response falls off with distance, how the frames are stored. Then tell me which of those choices make it feel calm.
            </Part>
            <Part name="Then rules">
              Turn what you find into rules I can hold a figure to, each sharp enough that I could reject a figure with it.
            </Part>
            <Part name="Then figures">
              Six at most. Each needs a reason to exist in a product, a way of answering the pointer, and the rules it leans on.
            </Part>
            <Part name="Off limits">
              Nothing of the reference survives: not its subjects, its frames or its code. One stroke width. No dependencies. Every figure holds up at 240px wide.
            </Part>
            <Part name="Shape of the answer">One Artifact I can play with, not a document I have to read.</Part>

        <Step n={3}>
          <p className="inspo-p">
            A dissection first, as asked: a 50ms stagger, one 700ms curve, <code className="doc-code">cubic-bezier(.32, .72, 0, 1)</code>, a falloff that drops from 128 to 40 to 12 away from the pointer, frames stored as 25-bit masks. Then eight rules, and six figures built on them: Riffle, Terrain, Exploded, Phosphor, Slow and Turntable.
          </p>
          <Shot src={dissection} alt="Three spec cards from the first Artifact: a timeline of the 50 millisecond stagger, a grid of 25-bit animation frames, and a chart of the falloff from 128 to 40 to 12." caption="The dissection: stagger, frames and falloff, measured." />
          <p className="inspo-p">A good first draft. That&rsquo;s all it was: something to argue with.</p>
          <Shot src={figures} alt="The six first-draft figures in a three by two grid of dark cards: a riffle of index cards, a field of pillars, an exploded stack of screens, a tile of lit dots, crates passing under a gate, and a turntable of blocks." caption="The first six figures, before any of the arguing." />
        </Step>

        <Step n={4}>
          <p className="inspo-p">
            Most of the work happened here. I questioned every number I couldn&rsquo;t feel, every figure I couldn&rsquo;t explain, and every motion that looked fine in a still and wrong under the hand. A few of those turns:
          </p>
          <ol className="inspo-pushback" data-pushback>
            {PUSHBACK.map((p) => (
              <li key={p.said} className="card">
                <p className="inspo-said">&ldquo;{p.said}&rdquo;</p>
                <p className="inspo-changed" data-changed>{p.changed}</p>
              </li>
            ))}
          </ol>
          <p className="inspo-p">
            Asking for sliders was the turn that paid most. Once the Artifact was a bench instead of a document, I stopped reading claims and started judging by hand: drag the knob, move the pointer, say exactly what feels off.
          </p>
          <p className="inspo-p">
            Those knobs later collapsed into a single option, <code className="doc-code">intensity</code>.
          </p>

        <Step n={5}>
          <p className="inspo-p">
            The motion was right; the drawings weren&rsquo;t mine yet. A model won&rsquo;t flag that on its own, so I wrote the critique the way I&rsquo;d give it to a designer: what&rsquo;s wrong, why, and the exact fix.
          </p>
          <Prompt label="The critique, paraphrased">
            <Part name="Keep">The motion. Don&rsquo;t touch timing, easing or falloff.</Part>
            <Part name="Corners">
              Every corner is hard. Round them properly: a solid is the hull of two rounded rings, not a box with a radius pasted on.
            </Part>
            <Part name="Weight">
              Every edge has the same weight, so nothing reads first. Make the silhouette bright, leave one dim crease inside, and stop drawing the vertical corners; the eye fills them in.
            </Part>
            <Part name="Words">
              Take every word out of the figures. If a figure needs an identity, carry it in geometry. Names go in the corner read-out.
            </Part>
            <Part name="Write it down">Make these rules 09 and 10, so the next figure can&rsquo;t break them.</Part>

                <p className="inspo-p">
                  A solid is the hull of two rounded rings. Its vertical corners are never drawn, its top edge is one dim crease, and a thin plate gets a single thickness line. Bright outside, dim inside.

                <p className="inspo-p">
                  Geometry carries identity: a punch on a card&rsquo;s tab, a dot code on a crate&rsquo;s lid. Names go to the read-out in the corner.

        <Step n={6}>
          <p className="inspo-p">
            The API was a design decision too. Six sliders became one <code className="doc-code">intensity</code>, because nobody using a figure should need to know what a falloff is. <code className="doc-code">theme</code> covers light and dark; <code className="doc-code">label</code> and <code className="doc-code">onRead</code> carry the read-out the words moved to. Then this site, and more arguing: Slow&rsquo;s gate was still being tuned after the figures shipped.
